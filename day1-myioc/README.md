# Lab 1 - Inversion of Control

In this lab you will develop an IoC framework. Your framework cannot have Spring libraries.

###  Requirements
---
* Create '@MyBean' annotation only for classes.
* Create '@MyAutowired' annotation only for fields.
* Create the Injector Class 'MyInjector' to search for annotations and create objects.
	* Scan all classes under the current package.
	* Create an instance for every class that has '@MyAutowired' annotation.
* Create a map to hold the instances of classes.
* Create a 'getBean(Class clazz)' method that returns the object of the class from the Map. Throw a BeanNotFoundException if there is no object of the class in the Map. (You need to create the exception.)
	

## Submission
---
* Fork the repository and push your changes.
* Once you finished your project, send a Pull Request. (Send only one Pull Request once you finish the assignment.)

### Important Notes
---

 * You are not allowed to share codes with your classmates. If detected, you will get NC.
 * **For pairs:**
	 * Individual's work will be checked from the commits.
	 *  Share tasks evenly and fairly.
	 *  To have a clearer understanding of pair programming:
		 *  > **Pair programming** is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the _driver_, writes code while the other, the _observer_ or _navigator_ reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. 
		 * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming#:~:text=Pair%20programming%20is%20an%20agile,two%20programmers%20switch%20roles%20frequently.)

-   Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden.
    
-   Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.
